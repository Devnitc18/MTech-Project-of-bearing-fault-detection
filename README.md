# Bearing Fault Detection using Deep Learning - README

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains code and resources related to a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness of deep learning approaches for bearing fault detection. The study compares these deep learning methods with traditional machine learning algorithms for detecting faults in bearings. The Case Western Reserve University dataset, widely used as a benchmark in the field, is utilized for the analysis.

## Dataset

The Case Western Reserve University dataset is included in this repository for easy access. It consists of bearing vibration signals under various fault conditions. The data is divided into training and testing sets, enabling the evaluation of different models on unseen data.

## Feature Extraction

Several feature extraction techniques have been explored to prepare the data for machine learning models. Two primary techniques used are:

1. Time Domain Technique: Statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and kurtosis are calculated to capture key characteristics in the time domain.

2. Time-Frequency Technique: Wavelet packet energy and wavelet packet entropy features are employed to capture frequency characteristics of the bearing fault signals.

## Visualization

Visualization techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE are utilized to gain deeper insights into the data. These techniques assist in selecting the appropriate algorithms by identifying patterns and potential separability in the feature space.

## Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms

The repository contains code for implementing traditional machine learning algorithms for bearing fault detection. The following algorithms have been evaluated:

- Multiclass Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees

The performance analysis of these traditional algorithms reveals their limitations, particularly when faced with complex data and insufficient feature representations.

## Deep Learning Models

To overcome the limitations of traditional approaches and improve performance, deep learning algorithms are directly applied to raw data. The following deep learning models are evaluated:

- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN1D)
- 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN2D)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Notably, the study extensively evaluates the CNN-LSTM model, which combines the power of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks, to assess its suitability for bearing fault classification.

## Conclusion

The study highlights the significance of employing deep learning approaches to enhance bearing fault detection. It emphasizes the limitations of traditional machine learning algorithms and underscores the critical role played by data quality and feature extraction techniques. By leveraging deep learning models, particularly the CNN-LSTM model, substantial improvements in accuracy and effectiveness of bearing fault detection can be achieved. These findings contribute to the advancement of fault detection methodologies and provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate algorithms in bearing fault analysis.
